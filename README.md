**Simple Tool for Amazon Route53**

CaveSpring is a Java based library to let you access Amazon's Route53 service from your Java code. It was written well before Amazon released an API. It works beautifully.

I have also added command line interface, in case you wanted to get stuffs done quickly.

##Usage##
TBD  --- 

##What's CaveSpring?##
If you see wikipedia [Georgia State Route 53](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Route_53)'s west end is Cave Spring. So, I named this project this way.
